 (excluding
                  sleep hours). Just think to yourself "do you relly want to do
                  something that you hate for 70% of your lifetime?", well I
                  would not want that. Also you would remain frustrated if you
                  do something that you don't like. If you love your job, you
                  will indeed find success and happiness. That's a simple point
                  I am trying to make here. Just follow your passion and chase
                  your dreams.
