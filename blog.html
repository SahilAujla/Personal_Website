            It was the end of 11th class, and my IT paper was about to arrive. I
            wasn't prepard for it at all. But then due to corona the paper was
            postponed and I was sent from school(residential setup) to home. I
            came home and thought to myself that I will have to study for IT
            exam because before that I never really tried to understand
            programming concepts. I searched on YouTube -- "Python Tutorial" and
            I found this bald guy with 6 hrs of python tutorial video with over
            9 million views.
          </p>
          <p>
            I clicked on that video -- and that click changed my life -- I
            followed along the whole course and within two days I completed it.
            At that ponint I had more than enough knowledge to give my IT exam
            but I was addicted to programming. I built some projects in python
            and then I tried a bunch of other programming languages like C++,
            Swift, Kotlin. I also explored a little bit about game development.
            I also did feelancing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays I am learning javascript. Infact this website is also made
            with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I like making fun projects and
            solving problems. So yeah that's pretty much it...Hope you enjoyed
            the blog.

            The importance of doing what you love

          <p class="featured_para">
            I have always been of the view that you should do what you love. But
            this thing lacks in our society. People often run after money. They
            would take a job that they hate for a little more money instead of
            taking one which they love. According to a research we spend 70% of
            our lifetime during work (excluding sleep hours). Just think to
            yourself "do you relly want to do something that you hate for 70% of
            your lifetime?", well I would not want that. Also you would remain
            frustrated if you do something that you don't like. If you love your
            job, you will indeed find success and happiness. That's a simple
            point I am trying to make here. Just follow your passion and chase
            your dreams.

          <h3 class="featured_heading">The feeling of helping others</h3>
          <span>19 May 2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
          <span class="featured--light">Story</span>
          <p class="featured_para">
            So the other day I went to the nearby village for some work. As I
            was riding bike I saw a guy standing on the side of road -- as some
            vehicle was approaching he would go ahead and ask for lift but no
            one was giving him lift. One Car nearly hit him. I felt pity for the
            poor guy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped my bike to give him lift and he asked me 3-4 times before
            sitting on the back that if he could sit or not -- as if he was
            could not believe that someone has stopped their vehicle for him. He
            wantd to go nearby. On the way he told me that he was going on work
            and the whole night also he was working and he came home at 5AM and
            now agian at 6AM his employer called him and he had to go to work
            again. I felt very bad for him. He only got one hour of sleep. I
            could see he was very hardworking and was doing everthing he could
            do to keep his family alive. At last when I dropped him, he thanked
            2-3 times again. I felt so good to help him. The feeling of
            contentment and fulfillment that I experienced by helping him, I
            cannot describe in words.

            The best unwilling purchase of my life
          </h3>
          <span>18 May 2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
          <span class="featured--light">Story</span>
          <p class="featured_para">
            The best purchase of my life is my laptop. My father bought the
            laptop for me when I was in 11th class. At that time he was in
            Kuwait(on his duty), he called me and said "I have bought a laptop
            for you" and I replied "No, I don't want a laptop. There's no use of
            laptop for me, I can do whatever I want in phone" but anyways, he
            bought the laptop and at that time It was relly of no use to me
            because I wasn't doing any programming at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I didn't know what life had hold for me. The same year I got
            into programming and I would not be able to continue programming
            without my laptop and I would not have found my passion by now. Also
            after that I learned programming and did some freelancing by which I
            earned money, so overall my laptop has paid it off. Though it was an
            unwilling purchase for me but it turned out to be the best one.
